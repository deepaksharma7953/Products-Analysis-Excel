# Manufacturer Performance in the Baby Care Market: Excel Project

## Project Overview

This Excel project is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of business performance in the baby care market. By utilizing Excel pivot tables and slicers, I created a report that offers a 360-degree view of business performance across various dimensions such as brands, package types, package sizes, and stock keeping units. This project will enhanced my data preprocessing skills and your proficiency in working with Excel pivot tables, using real-world Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) data.

## Objective

The primary goal is to produce a well-structured report that enables management to understand and scrutinize the performance of different aspects of their product range over time. This analysis is crucial for tracking performance, monitoring industry trends, and uncovering detailed insights at various breakdown levels.

## Target Audience
