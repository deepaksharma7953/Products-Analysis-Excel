# Baby Care Product Analysis Using Pivot Tables in Excel Project

## Project Overview
This project delves into the analysis of market dynamics and manufacturer performance in the baby care product segment. Using Excel as the primary tool, I leveraged pivot tables and slicers to create comprehensive reports, offering a 360-degree view of business performance. This analysis is crucial for understanding the performance of various brands, package types, sizes, and stock keeping units over time.

## Feature Tools
- Microsoft Excel

## Case Description
In this project, my data preprocessing skills and proficiency in working with Excel pivot tables were challenged. I worked with real-world Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) data to craft a well-structured report. This report will provide decision-makers with the flexibility needed to scrutinize performance and uncover detailed insights at granular levels. 

This project is tailored for intermediate to advanced students and is best approached after completing introductory courses in Excel and data analysis with pivot tables.

## Project Content
### Part 1: Data Preprocessing
Prepare and clean dataset for analysis.

### Part 2: Primary Report Table Structure
Set up the fundamental structure of report using pivot tables.

### Part 3: Fill in the Report
Populate the report with data, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

### Part 4: Insert Slicers
Implement slicers to enhance interactivity and ease of data navigation within the report.

### Part 5: Interpretation
Analyze and interpret the data to extract meaningful insights and trends.

## Interpretation

### Industry Overview
The baby care market saw a 3.2% growth in sales year-over-year (22-23), driven by a combination of a 2.2% increase in average prices and a 1% growth in volume. This growth, characteristic of a mature market, reflects moderate yet stable development.

### Top Manufacturer Performance
1. **ErusHealth Products**: Showcased a significant 761% increase in sales, likely due to an 18% decrease in average prices and the introduction of new products, including alcohol products in 2023.
   
2. **More beauty**: Experienced a 212% revenue increase, contradicting the typical price-volume relationship by increasing both price and volume sold. Notably, the shift towards Alcohol-Free products and the introduction of the 120 size played a critical role in this growth.

3. **SigmaKappaZeta Co.**: Marked a 175% increase in sales, aided by a 17% reduction in average price and strong performance in the 72 PH balanced and new 120 product sizes.

### Product Attributes Development
- **Alcohol-Free Products**: Enjoyed a significant growth (+20%) in sales and volume, with stable pricing.
- **PH Balanced Products**: Saw a 1.7% revenue decrease, despite a 5.2% price increase.
- **Sensitive Products**: Grew by 13%, even with an 11% price decrease.
- **Products Without Extra Protectcare**: Experienced a 6% decline in sales following a 2% price increase.

### Market Insights
Price sensitivity is a key factor in this market. Products that maintained or reduced prices saw increased sales, indicating significant price elasticity that management should consider in strategic planning.
